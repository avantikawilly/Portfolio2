        <p>I live in the beautiful Bay Area, California, with my mom, dad, and younger brother. I am currently a senior at Dublin High School and will be graduating in the spring of 2020. This year I have begun to build my knowledge of different coding languages, and I hope to become proficient in a few by the time I graduate. After graduating from Dublin High School, I plan to attend Georgetown University and major in international business. I have a passion for gaining new global perspectives, and the study of international business allows me to do just that.
          </br>
        A career in international business requires you to have a wide variety of skills and characteristics, such as overseas experience, sensitivity to cultural differences, global strategic thinking, good negotiating skills, and many more. I have been fortunate enough to travel to over 14 different countries in my lifetime, and have visited four out of the seven continents. Being able to travel to a variety of places has allowed me to experience firsthand the cultural diversity as well as immersing myself in the country. These experiences have given me a unique global perspective and will help me immensely as I pursue the study of international business.
        </br>
        During my time in high school, I was part of several clubs as well as being a nationally ranked tennis player. I was able to balance my rigorous sports schedule and maintaining over a 4.0 GPA, a few of the clubs I participated in were; CSF, Environmental Advocacy, and STEM Club. I also interned at the Naz Foundation located in Mumbai, India during my junior year of high school, this internship allowed me to help underprivileged school girls achieve better education and way of living. Throughout my school years, I have developed a curiosity and a love for learning new things, that I hope to continue well into the future.
        </br>
        Thank you for your time, and if you would like to contact me with any further questions or concerns please go to my Contact page and my information is there!

      <h6><strong>Scratch Project</h6></strong>
        <p>September 3, 2019. CSP 
        </br>
        The objective of this project was to design and create your own game or story utilizing Scratch. My partner and I decided to code a Matrix Mini Maze Ball Game. The goal of the game was to get the ball to the end of the maze without hitting obstacles or running out of time. The game consists of several levels that progressively get harder as the player advances. Each level would have a different maze layout, new obstacles for the player to avoid, as well as a set time limit. At the end of each level, your score would be shown on the scoreboard and it would be compared with the highest score you have achieved while playing that game. My role was to both brainstorm ideas for the game as well as code it, my partner and I took turns coding the game and it was challenging to figure out the many different commands we needed to implement for our game to be executed perfectly. In the end, I was able to learn how to think critically to solve problems, as well as learn how to appeal to the users you are targeting with your game.</p>

        <h6><strong>Online Portfolio</h6></strong>
        <p> 
          In this project I was able to put my skills I learned about both HTML and CSS into play. The objective of this project was to build from scratch a website that would serve as an online portfolio for myself. So it had to have difference sections that included a variety of information about me that I could consistently add to and update as I complete more. This was the first large individual project I completed and it allowed me to assess my areas of strengths and weaknesses. I was able to both apply the skills I had learned, as well as develop new skills throughout the project. I enjoyed this project because the guidleines allowed us to experiment with what we wanted to do and get creative with our portfolio.
